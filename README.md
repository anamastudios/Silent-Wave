# Description
This game was made for the Game Off game jam.

Welcome to Operation Silent Wave!

You play as Agent Blazer and you have to break into the hotel via the canal.

Thanks to the hotels weak security, you can use your simple interference device and open the doors with it. The only good security left are the mutants in the canal. These can't hear nor see but only feel. So if a water wave hits them, they wake up and track you down by your smell and attack you. Inside the hotel, you have to follow the target to his room. Don't go too near him as well try to avoid stepping on the broken floor, because he will kill you.

If you have followed the target to his room, you take the shot and the game is done.
